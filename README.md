# Globelet

Lightweight vector maps on a globe

Inspired by [Leaflet][]: a simple, light-weight mapping library, without the 
distortion of flat maps. Show your GIS data in 3D, as it would appear from 
space.

See a [simple example][] with geojson data displayed over the [Basic Style][]
from [OpenMapTiles][].

Like Leaflet, we design for *simplicity*, *performance*, and *usability*.

Need lots of features, like 3D buildings? Try [CesiumJS][]. Globelet will only do
a few things, but it will do them well.
